\title{Plot colour helper}
\usage{
plotHelper(code, colours, returnCode = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{Code for a plot. You can use the variable \code{CPCOLS} in this
code to refer to the colours that you will pick. If you do not provide any
code, the plot helper will initialize with sample code. The code can be
provided as text or as R code.}

\item{colours}{A vector of colours to use as the initial colours in the tool.
If you provide an integer instead of a vector of colours, the tool will load
with that number of colours, and default colours will be used initially.
If you do not provide this parameter, the tool will attempt to guess how many
colours are needed in the \code{code} and initialize that many colours.}

\item{returnCode}{If \code{TRUE}, return the plot code and the \code{CPCOLS}
variable as text. If \code{FALSE} (default), return the vector of selected
colours.}
}
\value{
When this function is called using \code{plotHelper()}, the chosen
colours are returned as a vector of colours. When this is run as an RStudio
addin (through the \emph{Addins} menu), the resulting code that includes the
colour vector gets inserted into the R document. As a side effect,
\code{CPCOLS} gets assigned in the global environment to the value of the
selected colours.
}
\description{
Allows you to interactively pick combinations of colours, to help you
choose colours to use in your plots. The plot updates in real-time as you
pick colours.\cr\cr
If you often find yourself spending a lot of time re-creating
the same plot over and over with different colours to try to find the best
colours, then the Plot Colour Helper can help you immensely.\cr\cr
\strong{Important:} The colours you pick will be available as a variable
called \code{CPCOLS}, so you can use \code{CPCOLS} in your plot code. See the
example below.

\details{
There are many keyboard shortcuts to help you be more efficient. For example,
pressing \emph{spacebar} adds a new colour, \emph{left}/\emph{right} keys
let you navigate between the selected colours, \emph{1-9} let you select any
of the first 9 colours. For a full list of keyboard shortcuts, click on
\emph{Show keyboard shortcuts}.
